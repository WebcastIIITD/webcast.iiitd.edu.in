            about : "Cities are systems with many different functions; transport, trade, administration, economic and social systems, culture to name a few. A 'smart city' therefore is 'the effective integration of physical, digital and human systems in the built environment to deliver a sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens.' To this end, smart cities mobilize many new technologies in achieving these goals.<br><br>Delhi is a mega metropolis, with various elements of smart city already in place. However, much more can be done to make Delhi Smarter through the use of Digital technologis and that is the focus of this workshop which IIIT-Delhi is organizing. This one-day workshop will have discussions with researchers, technologists, and opportunities and the associated challenges in making Delhi smarter through the use of Digital technologies.<br><br>The workshop will have sessions on Infrastructure and applications (including mobility, energy, health, etc.) Each session will offer a short summary of the key challenges and opportunities for making Delhi smarter in that area, some examples, and some recommendations for research and development both by academia and industry.<br><br>In the afternoon there will be a session \"Smarter Delhi: Solutions from Citizens\". Delhi has a large number of highly educated citizens with global exposure and varied expertise and experience; participation of citizens in evolving solutions for improvement can result in practical ideas for improving life of residents of Delhi by making Delhi Smarter. For this session, we will crowd source \"implementable solutions\" for smarter Delhi from the people of Delhi. A panel of experts, government representative, and representative from Delhi Dialog Commission, will select best solutions and the proposers will have a chance to present them at this workshop. Delhi Government has assured that some of the winning ideas will be taken up for implementation by the Government.",
